title: About Me
---

Hi! I'm Phil Chang, a recent graduate of Carnegie Mellon University's Materials Science and Engineering program (Class of 2015). I like to experiment in many different interests and this website serves to document some of the many personal projects I've worked on in the past few years.

I'm an avid audiophile, always interested in trying and listening to new experiences. I've used my skills in audio as an active member of my church and college fellowship, [Rutgers Community Christian Church] (http://ec.rccc.org/) and CMU's [Asian Christian Fellowship] (http://acfpcc.org/), where I've served the Lord joyfully behind the soundboard as part of the Audio/Visual team. I've also done live mixing for CMU's Christian a capella group, [Joyful Noise] (http://cmujoyfulnoise.com/).

I'm also a huge basketball fan, whether it's playing pickup on the court or faithfully following the Boston Celtics. I like to see the game from both a physical and mental standpoint, and the sheer depth of the game of basketball continues to astound and intrigue me.

My other interests include, but aren't limited to: playing musical instruments (cello, piano, electric bass), anime, cooking, home improvement projects, reading, computer programming, hobbyist electronics, tinkering, physics, meteorology, trivia, and dogs.

Please bear with any missing content as this website is still under construction.

title: DIY Custom IEMs 
---

Custom IEMs are the muscle cars of the musician and audiophile world; powerful and functional, yet highly varied and customizable. Typically made of acrylic or silicone, they are molded to a listener's ear to provide a complete and comfortable seal that has unparalleled noise attenuation. They are fitted with drivers (often multiple per ear) specifically tuned to create a specific sound signature based on one's needs and tastes. And like muscle cars, they are highly priced - often in the range of $500 or more per pair. 

During the summer of 2015, I chanced upon an interesting thread on Head-Fi. An increasingly larger group of Head-Fi users had started and continued a thread about manufacturing custom IEMs at home using some components and materials that could be easily bought online.

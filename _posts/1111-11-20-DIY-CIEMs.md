title: DIY Custom IEMs 
---

Custom IEMs are the muscle cars of the musician and audiophile world; powerful and functional, yet highly varied and customizable. Typically made of acrylic or silicone, they are molded to a listener's ear to provide a complete and comfortable seal that has unparalleled noise attenuation. They are fitted with drivers (often multiple per ear) specifically tuned to create a specific sound signature based on one's needs and tastes. And like muscle cars, they are highly priced - often in the range of $500 or more per pair.

During the summer of 2015, I chanced upon an interesting [thread](http://www.head-fi.org/t/430688/home-made-iems) on Head-Fi. An increasingly larger group of Head-Fi users had started and continued a thread about manufacturing custom IEMs at home using some components and materials that could be easily bought online. Needless to say, I was very intrigued.

After reading the entirety of the Head-Fi thread and taking notes on what worked and what did not, I went ahead and bought materials and tools for embarking on this endeavor. 

The general idea was to take silicone impressions of my ear canals, create a transparent negative mold out of gelatin, use the negative mold to cast a positive shell using UV-cured acrylic, then populate the shell with the drivers and electronics for the IEM. Simple enough, right?

First things first, I had to get impressions taken of my ears.

These impressions cost $40 for the pair at a local audiologist's office. There are kits and tutorials to doing this at home, DIY style, but I didn't feel the risk of ripping out an eardrum or two was worth the ~$15 it would save. 

As the impressions are made out of a silicone rubber, they have a rough and grippy texture. If we created a mold out of the impressions as-is, they would transfer the rough and grippy texture to the acrylic cast, which would then irritate the hell out of my ears. The solution was to dip the impressions in wax to smooth them out and also add a bit of thickness to help with the seal between the CIEM and the ear canal.

I bought several blocks of beeswax and got to work trying to melt them. This proved somewhat difficult because I didn't have the kitchen equipment to set up a double-boiler.

I ended up taking the beeswax, placing them in a double-walled metal cup and using my desktop halogen lamp to melt the beeswax.

After dipping the impression in the beeswax, we have some very smooth impressions ready for casting molds!

I mixed up some Knox gelatin (INSERT RECIPE) and poured it into paper cups, and used some helping hands to hold the impressions in the gelatin, ear canal pointing down.

After a day in the refrigerator, the gelatin set and the transparent molds are complete!

Remove the impressions carefully and then....

Remove the molds from the paper cups! You can see the outline of the impressions from the side.

The next step is to cast an earphone shell from the mold. This will be done by pouring a UV-curable resin into the mold and covering the top of the mold, then curing the resin from the sides of the mold using a UV chamber. The excess resin is then poured out of the top of the mold, which was covered earlier. I experimented with different cure times to create different shell thicknesses.

The resin that I used was Gelaze Top Coat - used for fingernail polish. Cheap and easily obtainable at my local nail salon supply store.

My UV chamber is a nail gel curing unit with a 9W bulb. It's relatively weak - thus, it takes 10-20 minutes to cure the resin to a reasonable thickness.

Curing the resin in the open air creates a tacky surface layer that needs to be removed. Dunking the cast into a glycerin bath for a second round of curing in the UV chamber tends to remove or cure the tacky surface layer into a nicely clean and glossy layer.

My first earphone shells are complete!

The biggest problem with the first set of shells was that they were way too big. The wax layer built up the shell so much that it no longer fit in my ear canal. Oh well - there's a lot of gelatin, so I made another set of molds without the wax coating on the impressions.

Note that because of the porous nature of the silicone impressions, there were a ton of bubbles in the mold.

You can see how the bubbles affect the end product - lots of little bumps and nodules (painful bumps and nodules, I might add) on the shell.

After a fair bit of sanding, we finally get something that I can put into my ear without causing worlds of pain.

A perfect fit!

A perfect pair!

I decided to try another UV nail gel resin that I bought off of eBay. This resin stunk a lot more than the Gelaze and was a lot less consistent in quality - some was runny and some was gummy and in general, was really hard to work with.

The next thing to try was to coat the impressions in UV nail gel resin to create a smoother mold. These shells were the ones to come out of that:

Beautiful.

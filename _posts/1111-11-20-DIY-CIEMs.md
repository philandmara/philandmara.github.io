title: DIY Custom IEMs 
---

Custom IEMs are the muscle cars of the musician and audiophile world; powerful and functional, yet highly varied and customizable. Typically made of acrylic or silicone, they are molded to a listener's ear to provide a complete and comfortable seal that has unparalleled noise attenuation. They are fitted with drivers (often multiple per ear) specifically tuned to create a specific sound signature based on one's needs and tastes. And like muscle cars, they are highly priced - often in the range of $500 or more per pair.

During the summer of 2015, I chanced upon an interesting [thread](http://www.head-fi.org/t/430688/home-made-iems) on Head-Fi. An increasingly larger group of Head-Fi users had started and continued a thread about manufacturing custom IEMs at home using some components and materials that could be easily bought online. Needless to say, I was very intrigued.

After reading the entirety of the Head-Fi thread and taking notes on what worked and what did not, I went ahead and bought materials and tools for embarking on this endeavor. First things first, I had to get impressions taken of my ears.

These impressions cost $40 for the pair at a local audiologist's office. There are kits and tutorials to doing this at home, DIY style, but I didn't feel the risk of ripping out an eardrum or two was worth the ~$15 it would save.

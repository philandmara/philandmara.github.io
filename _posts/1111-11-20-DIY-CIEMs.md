title: DIY Custom IEMs 
---

Custom IEMs are the muscle cars of the musician and audiophile world; powerful and functional, yet highly varied and customizable. Typically made of acrylic or silicone, they are molded to a listener's ear to provide a complete and comfortable seal that has unparalleled noise attenuation. They are fitted with drivers (often multiple per ear) specifically tuned to create a specific sound signature based on one's needs and tastes. And like muscle cars, they are highly priced - often in the range of $500 or more per pair.

During the summer of 2015, I chanced upon an interesting [thread](http://www.head-fi.org/t/430688/home-made-iems) on Head-Fi. An increasingly larger group of Head-Fi users had started and continued a thread about manufacturing custom IEMs at home using some components and materials that could be easily bought online. Needless to say, I was very intrigued.

After reading the entirety of the Head-Fi thread and taking notes on what worked and what did not, I went ahead and bought materials and tools for embarking on this endeavor. 

The general idea was to take silicone impressions of my ear canals, create a transparent negative mold out of gelatin, use the negative mold to cast a positive shell using UV-cured acrylic, then populate the shell with the drivers and electronics for the IEM. Simple enough, right?

First things first, I had to get impressions taken of my ears.

These impressions cost $40 for the pair at a local audiologist's office. There are kits and tutorials to doing this at home, DIY style, but I didn't feel the risk of ripping out an eardrum or two was worth the ~$15 it would save. 

As the impressions are made out of a silicone rubber, they have a rough and grippy texture. If we created a mold out of the impressions as-is, they would transfer the rough and grippy texture to the acrylic cast, which would then irritate the hell out of my ears. The solution was to dip the impressions in wax to smooth them out and also add a bit of thickness to help with the seal between the CIEM and the ear canal.

I bought several blocks of beeswax and got to work trying to melt them. This proved somewhat difficult because I didn't have the kitchen equipment to set up a double-boiler.

I ended up taking the beeswax, placing them in a double-walled metal cup and using my desktop halogen lamp to melt the beeswax.

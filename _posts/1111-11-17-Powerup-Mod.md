title: PowerUp v3.0 Modification 
---

Over one summer, I bought a PowerUp v3.0 off of eBay to play with. The PowerUp is a small toy which attaches to any paper airplane that one can make and allows you to both fly the paper airplane with powered flight and control it with a Bluetooth smartphone app (which also, sadly, limits the flight to ~30 ft).

As beautiful the packaging was, I immediately unpacked it and attached it to an airplane to try out. On the first flight, I watched in shock and awe as the airplane took off from my hands... only to loop into a tight spiral and plummet to the ground. I tried it again without trying to steer with the smartphone. Then I looked a little closer.

Unfortunately, the unit I bought came with a defective issue. The magnetically-actuated rudder on the back of the unit was wildly off-center, even when corrected with the software trim. When the unit was idling, it would point to the left at an angle of 40 degrees from the axis of the unit. Upon closer inspection, I saw that the rudder itself held a magnet and was actuated by an electromagnet that coiled around the magnet, inducing it to flip orientations and thus actuate the rudder.

Thus, I decided to perform a simple fix. I found that by holding a small neodymium magnet near the actuator casing, I could change the magnetic field of the built-in permanent magnet enough to hold the rudder at center. Once I found a spot where it would hold the rudder at center, I fixed it to the actuator casing with cyanoacrylate. Voila!

It proved to be a very simple and effective fix. Because of the added force of a small magnet on the side, the PowerUp has more difficulty making left turns than right turns, but it is a small trade-off for being able to fly at all.

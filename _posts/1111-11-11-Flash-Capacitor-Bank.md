title: Flash Capacitor Bank
---

This is a project I've added to and developed since high school. Ever since I first took apart a disposable camera and got shocked by accidentally touching the flash capacitor, I've wondered what else I could do with the stored energy. Hence, I made a capacitor bank to perform various high voltage discharge experiments.

title: DIY Custom IEMs - Part 2 - Electronics and Finishing
---

With the shells made, the final steps are to add drivers and electronics into the shell and add acoustic tubing and dampers to tune their sound output.

The drivers themselves are manufactured by Knowles, who provide detailed specification sheets about the frequency response of the drivers. These frequency response charts can be used in conjunction with various low/high-pass filters and dampers (small tubes with various baffles to adjust the frequency response) to create a desired sound between multiple drivers.

The specific drivers I decided to go with for this IEM was a Knowles GK-31732 with an additional Knowles CI-22955 driver attached to it. The GK driver is a packaged triple driver - it uses a CI-22955 (woofer) with a dual-driver TWFK-30017 (tweeter) attached to a proprietary crossover circuit for easy drop-in to any earphone application. I wanted a bit more bass impact so I opted to add another CI driver into the crossover circuit in parallel with the existing CI driver. It should lower the combined impedance of the CI drivers and thus increase the current through the two woofers, creating more bass presence. 

The CI driver is technically a full-range driver (meaning it can output with decent clarity at most audible frequencies). Since we're using it as a woofer, we will use a damper to muffle higher frequencies, leaving the bass frequencies untouched. There are multiple other methods to create a low-pass filter, including electronic crossovers or using very long and narrow acoustic tubing.

In this image, you can see the CI drivers on the side with two GK drivers in the middle.

Finger for scale.

The first step is to solder the CI driver to the GK driver's CI driver.

Then solder an MMCX connector to the GK driver so I can connect my Shure IEM cables.

Now to deal with the acoustic tubing.

The nozzles of the GK driver are incredibly close together - too close to allow two pieces of tubing for each nozzle. So why not use one?

Seems to work okay.

Now to work the tubing from the additional CI driver into the GK tubing. I created this splice by slicing open a hole in one tubing and gluing another piece of tubing onto the hole.

Then stick a damper into the spliced tubing.

Seems to work! The CI sits nicely beside the GK.

Time for an in-ear test. Sounds ok! Definitely can be improved as the bass is a bit bloomy.

Now we throw everything into the shells we made earlier.

So beautiful.

Now to seal off the shell. The electronics stick a little beyond the plane of the shell, so what I did was use plastic wrap to seal the electronics to the shell and create a plastic layer that I coated with additional UV nail gel to create a fully custom-formed shell. I used this formed shell as the lid.

Worked like a charm!

With a bit of paint, these custom earphones are ready!

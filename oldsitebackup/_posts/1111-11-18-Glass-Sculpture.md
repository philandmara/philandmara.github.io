title: Glass Sculpture 
---

I took a glass sculpture class the spring of my senior year. It was interesting seeing the things I've learned as a matsci major come into play in an art form - melting, glass composition, viscosity, tempering, temperature gradients, temperature-induced strain, etc. Definitely a great class and a great time.

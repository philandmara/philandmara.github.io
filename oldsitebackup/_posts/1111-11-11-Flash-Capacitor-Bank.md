title: Flash Capacitor Bank
---

This is a project I've added to and developed since high school. Ever since I first took apart a disposable camera and got shocked by accidentally touching the flash capacitor, I've wondered what else I could do with the stored energy. Hence, I made a capacitor bank to perform various high voltage discharge experiments.

I bought a bag of flash capacitors off of Digikey and got to work soldering them in parallel.

The charging switch, which does not touch the capacitor bank circuit. The capacitors remain charged until they are discharged through the discharge tips.

The entire system is builtÂ into an acrylic box for safety. When stored, the capacitors are discharged and the AA batteries removed.
